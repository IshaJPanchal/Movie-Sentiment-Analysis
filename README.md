# Movie-Sentiment-Analysis

In this I have taken IMDB Dataset which consists of 5000 entries

This is a basic text processing and analysis project where the sentiments of movie reviews are calculated and analyzed.

The dataset contains some impurities such as html tags and more so the dataset is first preprocessd and then tokenized and used porter stemmer for stemming.

For performing sentiment analysis I have used "vaderSentiment" as it also understands shortcuts used by people on social media and processes them which gives better accuracy
